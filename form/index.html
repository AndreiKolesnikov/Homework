        <div class="last-div">
            <p>The city of Mtskheta in Georgia is located just north of Tbilisi, in the region of Mtskheta-Mtianeti. This is a small and very ancient city with a rich history, which is worth visiting for lovers of sightseeing holidays and breathtaking mountain landscapes. Frequent visitors to Mtskheta, sometimes called the second Jerusalem, are Christian pilgrims who come to see ancient temples and monasteries. The city should also be visited by those who love Georgian wine, because the Ch√¢teau Mukhrani winery is within easy reach from here.</p>
